### 🌒 Adding Realism
---
Have you ever wondered what makes a scene look realistic?
Adding **Shadow** to 3D objects may quickly add depth to your creations.😎
In this tutorial, we'll show you how to use Shadow Dropper to quickly apply shadows.
In less than 5 minutes, you can create realistic shadows for all the meshes inside your scene.⏱️
:::tip First, let's set up a simple scene!
👀 If you haven't started there, check out [that tutorial first](SimpleScene.mdx)!

### 🎲 Creating a Cube Mesh
---
Let's start by adding a Cube, which we can dissect.
We will create a [Cube](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=box#api/en/geometries/BoxGeometry)
with `3x3x3` dimensions and use red color for the material.

```js
import * as THREE from "three";
import * as OBC from "openbim-components";
import Stats from "stats.js";
import * as BUI from "@thatopen/ui";
import * as OBCF from "../..";

const container = document.getElementById("container")!;

const components = new OBC.Components();

const worlds = components.get(OBC.Worlds);

const world = worlds.create<
  OBC.SimpleScene,
  OBC.SimpleCamera,
  OBCF.RendererWith2D
>();

world.scene = new OBC.SimpleScene(components);
world.renderer = new OBCF.RendererWith2D(components, container);
world.camera = new OBC.SimpleCamera(components);

world.scene.setup();

components.init();

world.camera.controls.setLookAt(5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0);

container.appendChild(world.renderer.three2D.domElement);

const grids = components.get(OBC.Grids);
grids.config.color.setHex(0xdddddd);
grids.create(world);
```
Now, we will add the Cube to the `Scene`. We must also add the **cube** to `components.meshes`,
which is simply an array of all the meshes in the Scene 🗄️.
**`components.meshes`** acts as a store to help you manage your elements centrally.

```js
const cubeGeometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(3, 3, 3);
const cubeMaterial = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({ color: "#6528D7" });
const cube = new THREE.Mesh(cubeGeometry, cubeMaterial);
cube.position.set(0, 1.5, 0);
```
### 🌚 Adding Beautiful Shadow
---
This completes our scene setup. Let's now include Shadows,
we'll use **`ShadowDropper`** and pass `components` as an argument to it.🔗

```js
world.scene.three.background = new THREE.Color("white");
world.scene.three.add(cube);
world.meshes.add(cube);
```
Shadow Dropper Component not only adds shadows to the scene, but it also helps you manage the **Shadows**.
To obtain the required results, you can alter the `ShadowDropper` parameters.🔧

```js
const shadows = new OBCF.ShadowDropper(components);
```
- `shadowExtraScalarFactor` - With this, the shadow's area of impact can be adjusted.
- `darkness` - This is used to increase or decrease the intensity of Shadow.
:::info SHADOW and realism ✨
Read the **Shadow Dropper** API for more on this.
The Shadow Dropper API offers more configuration options to render realistic shadows.
:::
### 🎨 Rendering Shadow
---
Now, we will use Shadow Dropper to create shadows for the element.
We will use **`renderShadow()`** to generate shadow for the `cube` we created.

```js
shadows.shadowExtraScaleFactor = 15;
shadows.shadowOffset = 0.1;
```
**renderShadow** requires two parameter, the `element` and a `shadowID`.
**shadowID** needs to be unique for the entire scene.
:::tip Deleting Shadows
❎ If you want to safely delete the shadow using **shadowID** you can call
**`shadows.deleteShadow(shadowId);`**
:::
**Congratulations** 🎉 on completing this tutorial!
Now you can add shadows to BIM Models or any 3D Object in minutes using
**Shadow Dropper** 🌗
Let's keep it up and check out another tutorial! 🎓

```js
const shadowID = "example";
shadows.create([cube], shadowID, world);
```
