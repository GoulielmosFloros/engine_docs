Now, streaming works by updating the scene depending on the user's perspective
and getting the necessary geometries from the backend. A simple way to achieve
this is by updating the scene each time the user stops the camera:

```js
world.camera.controls.addEventListener("sleep", () => {
  loader.culler.needsUpdate = true;
});
```
As you can imagine, downloading the geometries from the server each time can
take time, especially for heavier geometries. This is why the stream loader
automatically caches the files locally to get them much faster. This means that
the loading experience the first time might be a bit slower, but then later
it will be much better. You can control this using the `useCache` property
and clear the cache using the `clearCache()` method:

```js
loader.useCache = true;

async function clearCache() {
  await loader.clearCache();
  window.location.reload();
}
```
You can also customize the loader through the `culler` property:
- Threshold determines how bit an object must be in the screen to stream it.
- maxHiddenTime determines how long an object must be lost to remove it from the scene.
- maxLostTime determines how long an object must be lost to remove it from memory.

```js
loader.culler.threshold = 10;
loader.culler.maxHiddenTime = 1000;
loader.culler.maxLostTime = 40000;
```
This is it! Now you should be able to stream your own IFC models and open them anywhere,
no matter how big they are! ðŸ’ª We will keep improving and making this API more powerful
to handle any model on any device smoothly.
