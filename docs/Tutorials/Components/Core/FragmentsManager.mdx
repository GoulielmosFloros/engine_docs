### 🧶 Managing Fragment Efficiently
---
Until recently, we had been adding 3D objects to the **Scene** with the traditional `scene.add` API.
We will now use **[Fragment](https://github.com/ThatOpen/engine_fragment)** to work with large BIM models.🏗️
Fragment are faster and easier to use Geometric API, which reduces draw calls and speeds up the processing of 3D objects.
In this tutorial, we will load and render `.frag` files using **Fragment Manager**.
:::tip First, let's set up a simple scene!

### 🧭 Fragment Powerhouse
---
Let's begin by including [Fragment Manager](../api/classes/components.FragmentManager),
which requires the parameter `component` to be provided to it.
In terms of capabilities, Fragment Manager is a true powerhouse.🏭

```js
const fragments = new OBC.FragmentsManager(components);
```
### 🧩 Add Fragment To Scene
---
Using a single API, a Fragment can be quickly added to the scene.
Everything else is taken care of by `fragment.load`, which makes it easier to render a **Fragment** file.💪💪

```js
let uuid: string = "";

async function loadFragments() {
  if (fragments.groups.size) {
    return;
  }
  const file = await fetch("https://thatopen.github.io/engine_components/resources/small.frag");
  const data = await file.arrayBuffer();
  const buffer = new Uint8Array(data);
  const group = fragments.load(buffer);
  world.scene.three.add(group);
  uuid = group.uuid;
  console.log(group);
}
```
:::tip Loading IFC files as Fragment
You're probably wondering how IFC files can be loaded as Fragment.
The same approach can be used to load an IFC file with a fragment;
[view its own tutorial](./FragmentIfcLoader.mdx) for further information.
:::
### 📤 Storing Fragment
---
**Fragment Manager** provides us with option to export the Fragment we have used in our Scene.
Fragment are exported to **[Blob](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob/Blob)**,
which can be used to generate a File and then download it.↗️
Let's see how you can use `fragment.export` in your code.

```js
function download(file: File) {
  const link = document.createElement("a");
  link.href = URL.createObjectURL(file);
  link.download = file.name;
  document.body.appendChild(link);
  link.click();
  link.remove();
}

function exportFragments() {
  if (!fragments.groups.size) {
    return;
  }
  const group = fragments.groups.get(uuid);
  if (!group) {
    return;
  }
  const data = fragments.export(group);
  const blob = new Blob([data]);
  const file = new File([blob], "small.frag");
  download(file);
}
```
:::info Creating Dynamic URLs
`URL.createObjectURL()` comes handy when you want to generate a URL for files that were generated programmatically.
You can read more about it [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/createObjectURL_static).
:::
### 🧹 Discard Fragment and Clean the Scene
---
At some point, you will require to render numerous Fragment and discard them when not needed.
You can use `dispose()` method which will remove the Fragment Meshes from the Scene.✂️
After using `fragments.dispose()`, you should reinitialize **Fragment Manager** to maintain it's original state for further uses.

```js
function disposeFragments() {
  fragments.dispose();
}
```
Loading a .zip fragment that you have locally is also quite easy:

```js
function importExternalFragment() {
  if (fragments.groups.size) {
    return;
  }
  const input = document.createElement("input");
  input.type = "file";
  input.onchange = async () => {
    if (!(input.files && input.files[0])) return;
    const file = input.files[0];
    if (file.name.includes(".frag")) {
      const url = URL.createObjectURL(file);
      const result = await fetch(url);
      const data = await result.arrayBuffer();
      const buffer = new Uint8Array(data);
      fragments.load(buffer);
    }
    input.remove();
  };
  input.click();
}

const gui = new dat.GUI();

const actions = {
  loadFragments: () => loadFragments(),
  disposeFragments: () => disposeFragments(),
  exportFragments: () => exportFragments(),
  importExternalFragment: () => importExternalFragment(),
};

gui.add(actions, "loadFragments").name("Load Fragments");
gui.add(actions, "disposeFragments").name("Dispose Fragments");
gui.add(actions, "exportFragments").name("Export Fragments");
gui.add(actions, "importExternalFragment").name("Import External Fragment");
```
**Congratulations** 🎉 on completing this short yet powerful tutorial!
Now you can render or export Fragment files in your BIM Apps using **[Fragment Manager](../api/classes/components.FragmentManager)** 🎯
Let's keep it up and check out another tutorial! 🎓
