### ⭕️ Aesthetic Clipping Edges
---
You can build whole BIM application using Components.💪
One such essential component is **Edges Clipper** which helps you to add Clipping Planes along
with beautiful yet functional edges.🖍️
:::info Advanced but Simple to use
⚡️ **Simple Clipper** and **Edges Clipper** are similar, but `Edges Clipper` offers more advanced options.
If you want to learn more about **[Simple Clipper](SimpleClipper.mdx)**, visit the tutorial.
:::
In this tutorial, we'll use the `EdgesClipper` to slice two distinct Cubes that each have a unique set of edge effects.
With the help of this tutorial, you can quickly add **Clipping Planes** and **Configurable Edges** to your project.🚀
:::tip First, let's set up a simple scene!
👀 If you haven't started there, check out [that tutorial first](SimpleScene.mdx)!
:::
### 🧩 Adding Objects to Scene
---
Let's start by adding two Cubes, we will create a [Box Geometry](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=box#api/en/geometries/BoxGeometry) and use it for both Meshes.
We'll use `Red` and `Blue` colored material for the cubes🎨, and place them at a particular distance apart.📏

```js
const cubeGeometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(3, 3, 3);
const redMaterial = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({color: "red"});
const redCube = new THREE.Mesh(cubeGeometry, redMaterial);
redCube.position.set(-2, 1.5, 0);
scene.add(redCube);
components.meshes.push(redCube);
const blueMaterial = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({color: "blue"});
const blueCube = new THREE.Mesh(cubeGeometry, blueMaterial);
blueCube.position.set(2, 1.5, 0);
scene.add(blueCube);
components.meshes.push(blueCube);
```
:::info Storing Components
🧰 After adding cubes to the scene, we must also add them to `components.meshes`,
which is just an array of all the meshes in the scene.🗄️
:::
### ⚔️ Slicing Some Cubes
---
Now that the setup is complete. Let's get started with the interesting part!
We will create **[Edges Clipper](../api/classes/components.EdgesClipper)** and pass the **components** and
**[Edges Plane](../api/classes/components.EdgesPlane)** to the constructor.

```js
const clipper = new OBC.EdgesClipper(components, OBC.EdgesPlane);
```
:::info PLANE WITH EDGES and TRANSFORMATION CONTROLS
🟦 **[Edges Plane](../api/classes/components.EdgesPlane)** helps us in adding Clipping Planes to the Clipper Component.
:::

```js
components.tools.add(clipper);
clipper.enabled = true;
clipper.visible = true;
```
When we set `clipper.enabled = true`, we will make the clipper functional; otherwise, clipping planes won't be formed.
:::tip Adding it to the tools component
The Tools Component will help you keep your code tidy. For more information about the Tools component, check out
[its own tutorial](./ToolsComponent.mdx). 🔍
:::
### 🖌️ Creating Fine Edges
---
Let's now prepare the materials that will be visible on the cube edges.
We will use **[LineMaterial](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=line#webgl_lines_fat)** for creating edges.
#### 💫 Using Line Material
After creating the Line Material we will add it to the **clipper**
using `clipper.styles.create(styleName: string, mesh: Mesh[], material: LineMaterial)`

```js
const redLineMaterial = new LineMaterial({color: 'blue', linewidth: 0.002});
clipper.styles.create("Red lines", [redCube], redLineMaterial);
const blueLineMaterial = new LineMaterial({color: 'red', linewidth: 0.003});
clipper.styles.create("Blue lines", [blueCube], blueLineMaterial);
```
### 🤝 Performing Clipping Events
---
We need a method for instantly producing a clipping plane;
this can be accomplished with either a `single click` or a `double click` of the mouse.
For this tutorial, we will use **Double Click**, to create a Clipper that will generate a
plane on the 3D object's face.

```js
container.ondblclick = () => clipper.create();
```
:::info Raycaster below the hood 🎩
We use the **[Simple Raycaster](SimpleRaycaster.mdx)** to determine if the intersection has occurred.
The clipper places a plane after detecting the face on which the mouse was clicked.
Here, the **EdgesClipper** handles everything for you 😎
:::
### 🧹 Deleting the Clipping Planes
---
Now that we know how to make multiple clippers, we must also know how to delete them when necessary.
Clipping Edges can be removed using `clipper.delete()` or `clipper.delete(plane)`, which deletes a single plane.
**clipper.delete()** deletes the plane on which your mouse pointer is now located.

```js
window.onkeydown = (event) => {
if (event.code === 'Delete' || event.code === 'Backspace') {
clipper.delete();
}
}
```
:::tip Delete all Clipping Planes
❎ If you want to safely delete all the clipping edges that were created you can simply call
**`clipper.deleteAll()`**
:::
Great job! 🎉 Using the **[Clipper Component](../api/classes/components.SimpleClipper)**,
you can now effortlessly check BIM models or any other 3D objects with stunning edges.🧐
