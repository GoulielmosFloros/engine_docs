### üç± Keeping things tidy
___
BIM applications are complex and can have a lot of different functionalities. Of course, this means that they can
have a lot of components. Keeping your project tidy and clean can be a challenge if you need certain components
in different places of your app.
Luckily, there's an easier way of handling this: the [Tools Component](../api/classes/components.ToolsComponent)!
This component has two purposes:
- Making your components available anywhere in your application.
- Getting your tools from [That Open Platform](../that-open-platform/getting-started.mdx).
### ‚ú® Components anywhere
___
First, we will create a very simple tool: a [simple grid component](../api/classes/components.SimpleGrid). It's not
very exciting, but we don't want to distract you with the fanciness of the component! This same workflow will work for
any other component that you use.
First, let's instantiate it:

```js
const grid = new OBC.SimpleGrid(components);
```
Now, it is likely that your application will have many menus. What if you need access to this component In many
places? For example, you may have a menu that controls the color and size of the grid, and other menus that goes
into floor plan navigation mode and need to hide the grid.
To solve this situation, you just need to add the SimpleGrid component to the ToolsComponent. That's it!

```js
components.tools.add(grid);
```
Now, getting the SimpleGrid component back is as easy as using the `get()` method and passing the name of the
component as an argument. That's it! üëá

```js
const grid = components.tools.get("SimpleGrid");
```
:::info Clean code, clean memory üßπ
The tools component also keeps track of the memory usage of the components and automatically cleans it for you when
you call `components.dispose()`,
[so that you don't have to](https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/How-to-dispose-of-objects).
:::
### ‚õÖ Components from the cloud
___
Maybe you have uploaded some components to That Open Platform and want to easily share them with someone. Or maybe you
have got some nice components in the Marketplace and want to use them in your app. Either way, using these components
is a piece of cake with ToolsComponent!
:::tip What's That Open Platform?
That Open Platform is a place where people can share, buy and sell their components for free. You can learn more about
how to get started [right here](../that-open-platform/getting-started.mdx).
:::
First, you will need a token to communicate with That Open Platform and the ID of the tool you want to üëá

```js
const token =
"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1IjoiYXV0aDB8NjNlNjU5MjY0OGM3M2ZlZjE2M2FkZDZhIiwiYSI6IjY0Mzk2ZDhkZTk4ZDcxY2NlZDFkYzQ3ZiJ9.RCAvy-YU8nRqd0pw-MYRA84GwxV3-4M62wf_37zpsbE";
const id = "643981b1d88f1db593855c8a";
```
Next, you can get the component with the `use` command. That will give you the class of the component, which you can
easily instantiate like a normal class. That's all it takes!
:::danger What about types?
If you want to get all the types and intellisense docs for the component,
[check this out](../that-open-platform/getting-started.mdx)!
:::

```js
const CustomComponent = await components.tools.use(token, id);
const component = new CustomComponent();
component.greet();
```
Fantastic work! üéâüéâüéâ Now you know how to keep your components tidy, and also get your components from the cloud.
