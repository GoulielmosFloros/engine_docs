### 🧪 Cool Post-Production Effects
---
Post-production effects enrich your 3D scenes. There are several post-production effects, such as
adding shadows, rendering outlines, adding ambient occlusion and applying bloom, that can enhance
and make your scene look cool.🍹
:::tip First, let's set up a simple scene!
👀 If you haven't started there, check out [that tutorial first](SimpleScene.mdx)!
:::
In this tutorial we will use **Post-Production Renderer** to add neat **Outlines** and **Ambient Occlusion** to the 3D Model.🦾
### 🏢 Adding Fragments
---
We'll start by adding a **Fragment** to our scene using Fragment Manager.
We'll use a simple fragment for the purposes of this tutorial, but the code is capable of handling big files as well.🏗️
:::info Using Fragment Manager!
🏋️ There is a dedicated tutorial on how to use Fragment Manager to load **IFC** files!
:::

```js
const fragments = new OBC.FragmentManager(components);
const file = await fetch("../../../resources/small.frag");
const data = await file.arrayBuffer();
const buffer = new Uint8Array(data);
fragments.load(buffer);
```
### 🎛️ Setting Up Post-Production
---
We'll now set up the post-production, which requires modifying the renderer to use the preferences we've specified.
Let's start by specifying the outline color, we'll set it to `0x999999`. Also, we will pass the
camera controls to the post-production object.

```js
components.renderer.postproduction.outlineColor = 0x999999;
components.renderer.postproduction.setup(components.camera.controls);
```
### ❎ Excluding Unwanted Elements
---
At times, we might have to turn off post-production effects for some elements.
By doing this, the scene is kept clean and unnecessary computation is avoided.🐢

```js
const gridMesh = grid.get();
components.renderer.postproduction.excludedItems.add(gridMesh);
```
### 🎬 Activating the Post-Production
---
Now that set up is complete, we wil activate the post-production effect.
Also, we will enable the visibility for post-production layer.
- `postproduction.active` - Enable or Disable the active status of the post-processing effect
- `postproduction.visible` - Toggle the visibility of post-processing layer that is created to display the effect.

```js
components.renderer.postproduction.active = true;
components.renderer.postproduction.visible = true;
```
### 🔄 Updating Post-Product Effect
---
Every time the **camera** is changed, we also need to update the post-production effect.🎥
In order to achieve this, we will write an easy timeout function that will be called after **1000** milliseconds.

```js
let timeout;
function updatePostproduction() {
clearTimeout(timeout);
components.renderer.postproduction.visible = false;
timeout = setTimeout(() => {
components.renderer.postproduction.active = true;
components.renderer.postproduction.visible = true;
components.renderer.postproduction.update();
}, 1000);
}
```
:::tip Timing the Function Execution
⏱️ Check out [setTimout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setTimeout) for more information on
how **setTimeout** can be useful when you want to run a function after a certain amount of time!
:::
Now, we will invoke the `updatePostproduction` method on mouse events.📢
The **updatePostproduction** function will be invoked each time a user scrolls to zoom-in or zoom-out and whenever any mouse buttons are pressed.

```js
window.onwheel = () => updatePostproduction();
window.onmousedown = () => updatePostproduction();
window.onmouseup = () => updatePostproduction();
```
**Congratulations** 🎉 on completing this tutorial! Now you know how to add cool effects easily using
Post Production 🖼️
Let's keep it up and check out another tutorial! 🎓
