## Let's create a 3D world! 🌍
The `SimpleScene` component is the easiest way to create a 3D space to start working.
Let's start by importing Components and Three.js:

```js
import * as THREE from 'three';
import * as OBC from 'openbim-components';
```
Now, the first step is getting a container for our viewer. 📦
This is just a place where the 3D scene will be rendered.

```js
const container = document.getElementById('container');
```
Next, we will instantiate the main object of the library: `Components`. 🔥
