### Let's create a 3D world! 🌍
The `SimpleScene` component is the easiest way to create a 3D space to start working.
Let's start by importing Components and Three.js:

```js
import * as THREE from 'three';
import * as OBC from 'openbim-components';
```
Now, the first step is getting a container for our viewer. 📦
This is just a place where the 3D scene will be rendered.
In this example we have just added an HTML `div` element with
the ID `"container"`.

```js
const container = document.getElementById('container');
```
Now, let's create an awesome 3D scene inside that HTML element! 🔥
:::info Are you using a library/framework like React, Angular or vue?
Then probably you have other mechanisms for getting a reference to the
HTML div element. However you do it, as long as you get a reference
in your code, you are good to go!

### Setting up a components project 🧰
Next, we will instantiate the main object of the library: [Components](../api/classes/components.Components). 🤖
This object will keep track of all the components that you create, making them
easily accessible in all your application and making sure to update them
in each frame, so you don't have to worry about that. 💪

```js
const components = new OBC.Components();
```
Great! But this object needs 4 things to work:
- 🌍 A **[scene component](../api/classes/components.SimpleScene)** where our objects will live in 3D.
- ⌚ A **[renderer component](../api/classes/components.SimpleRenderer)** that will allow us to see things moving around.
- 🎥 A **[camera component](../api/classes/components.SimpleCamera)** that defines where we are and what are in that 3D world.
- ⚡ A **[raycaster component](../api/classes/components.SimpleRaycaster)** that makes it possible to interact with that 3D scene with our mouse / finger.

```js
components.scene = new OBC.SimpleScene(components);
components.renderer = new OBC.SimpleRenderer(components, container);
const camera = new OBC.SimpleCamera(components);
components.camera = camera;
components.raycaster = new OBC.SimpleRaycaster(components);
```
Now that everything is set up, let's start the app! You can do that with the `init` method: 🚗💨💨💨
