# IfcRelationsIndexer

Indexer component for IFC entities, facilitating the indexing and retrieval of IFC entity relationships. It is designed to process models properties by indexing their IFC entities' relations based on predefined inverse attributes, and provides methods to query these relations. ðŸ“• [Tutorial](https://docs.thatopen.com/Tutorials/Components/Core/IfcRelationsIndexer). ðŸ“˜ [API](https://docs.thatopen.com/api/@thatopen/components/classes/IfcRelationsIndexer).

### onRelationsIndexed

> `readonly` **onRelationsIndexed**: [`Event`](Event.md)\<`object`\>

Event triggered when relations for a model have been indexed.
This event provides the model's UUID and the relations map generated for that model.

#### Type declaration

##### modelID

> **modelID**: `string`

##### relationsMap

> **relationsMap**: `RelationsMap`

***

### relationMaps

> `readonly` **relationMaps**: `ModelsRelationMap` = `{}`

Holds the relationship mappings for each model processed by the indexer.
The structure is a map where each key is a model's UUID, and the value is another map.
This inner map's keys are entity expressIDs, and its values are maps where each key is an index
representing a specific relation type, and the value is an array of expressIDs of entities
that are related through that relation type. This structure allows for efficient querying
of entity relationships within a model.

A unique identifier for the component.
This UUID is used to register the component within the Components system.

### getEntityRelations()

> **getEntityRelations**(`model`, `expressID`, `relationName`): `null` \| `number`[]

Retrieves the relations of a specific entity within a model based on the given relation name.
This method searches the indexed relation maps for the specified model and entity,
returning the IDs of related entities if a match is found.

#### Parameters

or the specified relation name is not indexed.

***

### getRelationsMapFromJSON()

> **getRelationsMapFromJSON**(`json`): `RelationsMap`

Converts a JSON string representing relations between entities into a structured map.
This method parses the JSON string to reconstruct the relations map that indexes
entity relations by their express IDs. The outer map keys are the express IDs of entities,
and the values are maps where each key is a relation type ID and its value is an array
of express IDs of entities related through that relation type.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `json` | `string` | The JSON string to be parsed into the relations map. |

#### Returns

`RelationsMap`

A `Map` where the key is the express ID of an entity as a number, and the value
is another `Map`. This inner map's key is the relation type ID as a number, and its value
is an array of express IDs (as numbers) of entities related through that relation type.

### process()

> **process**(`model`): `Promise`\<`RelationsMap`\>

Processes a given model to index its IFC entities relations based on predefined inverse attributes.
This method iterates through each specified inverse attribute, retrieves the corresponding relations,
and maps them in a structured way to facilitate quick access to related entities.

The process involves querying the model for each relation type associated with the inverse attributes
and updating the internal relationMaps with the relationships found. This map is keyed by the model's UUID
and contains a nested map where each key is an entity's expressID and its value is another map.
This inner map's keys are the indices of the inverse attributes, and its values are arrays of expressIDs
of entities that are related through that attribute.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `model` | `FragmentsGroup` | The `FragmentsGroup` model to be processed. It must have properties loaded. |

#### Returns

`Promise`\<`RelationsMap`\>

A promise that resolves to the relations map for the processed model. This map is a detailed
representation of the relations indexed by entity expressIDs and relation types.

#### Throws

An error if the model does not have properties loaded.

***

### processFromWebIfc()

> **processFromWebIfc**(`ifcApi`, `modelID`): `Promise`\<`RelationsMap`\>

Processes a given model from a WebIfc API to index its IFC entities relations.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `ifcApi` | `IfcAPI` | The WebIfc API instance from which to retrieve the model's properties. |
| `modelID` | `number` | The unique identifier of the model within the WebIfc API. |

#### Returns

`Promise`\<`RelationsMap`\>

A promise that resolves to the relations map for the processed model.
         This map is a detailed representation of the relations indexed by entity expressIDs and relation types.

***

### serializeAllRelations()

> **serializeAllRelations**(): `string`

Serializes all relations of every model processed by the indexer into a JSON string.
This method iterates through each model's relations indexed in `relationMaps`, organizing them
into a structured JSON object. Each top-level key in this object corresponds to a model's UUID,
and its value is another object mapping entity expressIDs to their related entities, categorized
by relation types. The structure facilitates easy access to any entity's relations across all models.

#### Returns

`string`

A JSON string representing the serialized relations of all models processed by the indexer.
         If no relations have been indexed, an empty object is returned as a JSON string.

***

### serializeModelRelations()

> **serializeModelRelations**(`model`): `null` \| `string`

Serializes the relations of a specific model into a JSON string.
This method iterates through the relations indexed for the given model,
organizing them into a structured object where each key is an expressID of an entity,
and its value is another object mapping relation indices to arrays of related entity expressIDs.
The resulting object is then serialized into a JSON string.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `model` | `FragmentsGroup` | The `FragmentsGroup` model whose relations are to be serialized. |

#### Returns

`null` \| `string`

A JSON string representing the serialized relations of the specified model.
If the model has no indexed relations, `null` is returned.

***

### serializeRelations()

> **serializeRelations**(`relationMap`): `string`

Serializes the relations of a given relation map into a JSON string.
This method iterates through the relations in the given map, organizing them into a structured object where each key is an expressID of an entity,
and its value is another object mapping relation indices to arrays of related entity expressIDs.
The resulting object is then serialized into a JSON string.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `relationMap` | `RelationsMap` | The map of relations to be serialized. The map keys are expressIDs of entities, and the values are maps where each key is a relation type ID and its value is an array of expressIDs of entities related through that relation type. |

#### Returns

`string`

A JSON string representing the serialized relations of the given relation map.

***

### setRelationMap()

> **setRelationMap**(`model`, `relationMap`): `void`

| `relationMap` | `RelationsMap` | The `RelationsMap` to be added to the model's relations map. |

#### Returns

`void`

#### Fires

onRelationsIndexed - Triggers an event with the model's UUID and the added relation map.
