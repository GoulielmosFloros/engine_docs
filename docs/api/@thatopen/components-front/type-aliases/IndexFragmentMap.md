# IndexFragmentMap

> **IndexFragmentMap**: `Map`\<`number`, `FRAGS.FragmentIdMap`\>

A map used to map the triangles of the clipping fill with the original fragment item. It's used to be able to trace to which elements a specific triangle of the clipping fill's face belongs (e.g. for highlighting an item when selecting one of its clipping fills).
